# Mental-Health-Support-App
This project is a Mental Health Support Mobile App designed to provide emotional assistance, self-care tools, and guided support for individuals experiencing depression, stress, and mental fatigue. The app focuses on creating a safe, non-judgmental, and user-friendly space where users can track their mental health, access support resources, and feel less alone.
The primary goal of the app is to reduce the gap between users and mental health support by offering accessible digital tools that encourage self-awareness, emotional expression, and positive coping habits.
